  <p>"Paella bestows an aura on the Valencia region, for it is not merely a regional food specialty but part of the very fiber of Valencian life.... Depending on what is combined with the rice, paella can be a poor man's meal or a deluxe extravaganza."  Casas, Penelope. Paella!: Spectacular Rice Dishes From Spain. New York, Henry Holt and Company, LLC, 1999.</p>

<p>As a Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) scholar, I had the privilege to be selected for a Language Intensive Training Event otherwise known as LITE.  Where did the venture take me?  Well, to the wonderful and beautiful city in Spain... Seville.  Here is where I was introduced to a dish named Paella.  Paella is a dish very popular in Spain and has many versions.  It receives my top recommendation in food to eat in Spain.  Below is a recipe I personally tried and enjoyed.  Although the traditional version includes seafood, I prefer the chicken</p>

<p> Step 1 <br>
Stir together lemon rind, juice, and saffron in a small bowl; set aside. <br>

Step 2 <br>
Heat oil in a 13- to 15-inch paella pan or skillet with lid over medium-high. Sprinkle chicken with black pepper and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Add 4 chicken thighs to pan; cook, skin side down, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Turn chicken over; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate; repeat with remaining 4 chicken thighs. Add onion, thyme, and garlic to pan; cook, stirring often, 4 minutes. Add rice; cook, stirring often, 2 minutes. Add wine; cook until reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice mixture, stock, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. Nestle chicken, skin side up, into rice. Cover and reduce heat to medium; simmer until rice is just al dente, about 18 minutes. Uncover pan. <br>

Step 3 <br>
Add peas and red pepper pieces. Increase heat to medium-high; cook until rice begins to brown on the bottom and edges of pan, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with parsley; serve with lemon wedges. <br>
