  <h1 style="font-size:2vw">About Me</h1>
 

  <p1 style="font-size:1vw">          My name is Alberto Rivera.  I was born in Southern California and moved to Missouri when I was 17. It was rough, the only thing
I wanted was to graduate with my high school friends.  I attended the first semester of 12th grade in Missouri but once I turned 18 (legally an adult) I 
drove back to California to graduate with my class of 2004.  It was a wonderful reunion and graduation, I was glad I got to drive back but sad at the 
same time.  I didn't mean it as a rebellious act against my guardian at the time, but it was the one thing I really ever wanted during High School.
After graduation I worked at McDonalds and saved enough money to drive back to Missouri.  It was there I completed my recruiting journey to the United
States Air Force </p1><br><br>

<p2 style="font-size:1vw">          I always wanted to be a Police Detective growing up. This is why when I joined the Air Force I chose the Security Forces
career field.  From my research before joining the military, it was this career field where I read I could develop myself on learning the Law Enforcement
basics, hopefully later lateral training into becoming an investigator.  Was I wrong... my first assignment took me to an area in Las Vegas where I 
protected aircraft on a flight line.  After 2 years it wasn't what I expected.  Long story short, some initial assignments or first-time experiences
isn't what you always picture it or imagine it being.  After 15 years in the Air Force, I do not regret a single thing! It is where I had the opportunity
to invest more in my  hobbies.  Console Gaming, PC Gaming, and computers.</p2>
